# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

#### What have I used in my project?

In this project I have used **HTML**, with a **CSS** style sheet to decorate my project along with that I have used **Git** to organise my 
folders and to make sure that the branches are up to date using the commit feature to ensure my notes are easy to follow.

#### What does my Webpage do?

My webpage gives links to various coding language wikipedias along with the respective logos behind that language. 
As this is my first project I have used skills that I have learnt early on to display my work. This project will allows easy access to information on coding
languages.
